### Hi, I'm Amani ðŸ‘‹

<img src= Ameni Ben Hassine.gif >

 I am a MERN stack developer . I have a strong background in web development and a passion for creating intuitive and visually appealing web applications.

I specialize in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) and have experience working on various projects ranging from small business websites to large-scale e-commerce platforms.

In my previous roles, I honed my skills in front-end development with React, as well as back-end development with Node.js and Express. I am also proficient in using MongoDB for database management and have a strong understanding of RESTful APIs.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a team player and thrive in collaborative environments. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.

I am excited to connect and explore new opportunities in the MERN stack development field. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
